## üìù Overview 

Machine learning system to detect fraudulent vehicle insurance claims using:

- **XGBoost** for classification  
- **SMOTE** for handling class imbalance 
- **MLOps** best practices for reproducibility

## üìÇ Dataset  

**Source**: [Kaggle Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/)

**Features**: 

- Claim details
- Policyholder information
- Vehicle specifications 
- Historical transaction data  

**Target Variable**:

`fraud_label` (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud)

# üåê Deployment

## Cloud Deployment

The vehicle insurance fraud detection app is live and hosted on **Streamlit Cloud**:

üîó [Live App on Streamlit Cloud](https://vehicleinsurancefrauddetection-mmqyvhriq3jdmluu3tpqog.streamlit.app/)

---

## Local Deployment

To run the app locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have all dependencies installed (see `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`).

2. From the project root directory, run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py


# üîÆ Usage Example

This example demonstrates how to load the trained XGBoost model and make a prediction on a sample input.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Required packages installed (`joblib`, `pandas`, etc.)
- Trained model saved as `models/xgboost_model.pkl`

---

## Example Code

```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load("models/xgboost_model.pkl")

# Prepare a sample input DataFrame
sample = pd.DataFrame({
    'claim_amount': [5000],
    'vehicle_age': [3],
    'past_claims': [2]
})

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(sample)

# Get fraud probability
probability = model.predict_proba(sample)[0][1]

print(f"Prediction: {'Fraud' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'Legitimate'}")
print(f"Fraud Probability: {probability:.1%}")


# üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned features and improvements for the Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection project.

## Upcoming Features

- **Initial Model Pipeline**  
  Establish a robust and reproducible machine learning pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **SHAP / LIME Explainability**  
  Integrate explainability tools like SHAP and LIME to provide insights into model predictions and feature importance.

- **FastAPI Backend**  
  Develop a FastAPI backend service to serve the model via REST API, enabling scalable and flexible integration.

- **User Authentication**  
  Implement user authentication and authorization for the application to secure access and enable personalized features.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time fraud detection with streaming data support  
- Advanced ensemble modeling and hyperparameter tuning automation  
- Dashboard enhancements with additional visualization and interactivity  
- Integration with external fraud databases and alerts
